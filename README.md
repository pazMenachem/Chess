Chess Game
As one of my favorites games, Ive wanted to create one of my own chess game using the some of the skills ive learned during college, just to mention, this *isnt* one of the college assignmets.
11.5 
At the moment the game include moving all pieces by their own rules, includes highlight possible positions while piece is "hanged".
unfortunately due college assignments for now ill have to put this project aside.

current issue:
knowing when the king piece is at check stat.
